# Explorius-Human-Tech
Welcome to Explorius ! 
Through this website, you have the opportunity to explore some countries and learn more about different cultures. It is an experience intended for children who might want to ally an enjoyable experience to learning.

For that, you have multiple interactions as : 
 - Clicking on different objects
 - Travel with a map
 - Write a postcard
 - Enjoy the experence with special features

To fit the atmosphere and create a good design for children, we were inspired by "It's a small world".
